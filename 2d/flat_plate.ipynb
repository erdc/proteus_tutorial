    "-----------\n",
    "The problem comprises a 0.40m x 4.00m (height x length) tank with smooth plate both at the bottom and\n",
    " the top of the domain.\n",
    "The water flows through the duct and interacts with the solid wall generating a boundary layer and tu\n",

    "\n",
    "At the close proximity of the wall, in the viscous sub-layer, viscous contribution to the shear stres\n",
    "s is significant and in general Reynolds stresses are negligible when compared with it.\n",
    "Turbulent effects become gradually more important in the inner region moving away from the solid wall\n",
    ". Velocity field assumes a logarithmic profile and the viscous effects can be considered negligible a\n",
    "t some point (log-law sublayer).\n",
    "\n",
    "In CFD models the near-wall sublayer is almost never resolved, as the first discretisation node from \n",
    "the wall typically falls within the inner region where the flow is governed by the logarihtmic law. T\n",
    "o account for this simlification, CFD models use a class of boundary conditions commonly refered to a\n",
    "s wall functions. These combine dimensional analysis, empirical formulations and input from the model\n",
    " to determin the near wall flow dynamics according tothe logarithmic law.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case serves as a benchmark for the wall function used in PROTEUS.\n",

    "Running the test case\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the test case type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "parun flat_plate.py --TwoPhaseFlow  -v -D result_folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dambreak and tank properties can be modified by the commandline, using for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "parun flat_plate.py --TwoPhaseFlow  -v -D result_folder -C \"nu=0.0001\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run in parallel (example with mpirun and 12 processors):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mpirun -np 12 parun flat_plate.py --TwoPhaseFlow  -v -D result_folder -C \"nu=0.0001\"\n",

    "The `parun` launcher is used to execute the split-operator module, in this case `flat_plate.py`. Various arguments may also be implemented to define various runtime options.
